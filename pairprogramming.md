# Pair Programming

Pair programming is an ancient and noble practice that involves two sage programmers combining their powers to tackle a problem together! How ancient could it possibly be, you ask? Well, it dates all the way back to the time of the ENIAC, which was the first programmable electronic digital computer...so the 1940s... practically the middle ages in computer terms.

This first version of pair programming didn't have many formalized rules, and often-times, it doesn't today either. It really depends on the preferences of the people and company you are working with. That being said, there are a few common flavours of pair programming out there that we'll cover!

## Pair Programming Styles

Regardless of which style you are participating in, it's always a good idea to have a chat beforehand. Figure out which style, sometimes referred to as technique, you'll be using, what your specific goals are going to be, how often you'll take breaks, and how often you'll switch roles.

### Driver and Navigator

This is one of the most well-known styles of pairing. It consists of assigning each person a different role: Driver or Navigator. These roles should be switched up often!

#### Driver

The Driver is the person at the keyboard and is focused on completing the tiny goal agreed upon beforehand. They should always be either thinking out-loud or listenting for feedback from the Navigator.

#### Navigator

The Navigator is responsible for thinking about the bigger picture and reviewing the code on the go. They'll be thinking about the general structure of the problem, and will suggest ideas on how to group or split the code. They will also keep a note of any new issues that you discover as you go, and make sure alternate ideas are tried if something isn't working.

### Strong Style

Strong style plays a bit with the driver and navigator roles we defined above. It decouples the coding and the typing, so any ideas must go through someone else's fingers. The driver is still the one doing the typing, but the navigator is now directly telling the driver what to type. You can think of it like helping your friend make your favourite recipe through a zoom call, but they're very unchef-y, so you have to be very specific in your instructions. If the driver has an idea they would like to implement, it's time to switch roles!

There's even an extended version of this when an entire team is working together with one person typing. It's called Mob Programming! It's very 2014, but you can find out more [here](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/mob-programming-agile2014/)

## Tips for successful pair programming session

### Switch often

Switching roles is key to both of the pairing styles we've discussed so far. It allows both people to actively contribute to the code and helps keep the energy levels up! If you're not sure how long you should spend in a particular role, 25 mins is a good starting point, and you can adjust the time to the needs of your team as you go. It might also be helpful to set a timer as a reminder to switch. This is also a good way to remember to commit and push your code to Github!

### Take breaks

Pair programming introduces an entirely new element to coding: another person! While having another person to work with is invaluable, it is also more exhausting, which just makes sense! We engage the part of our brain that handles communication, in addition to all the coding we're doing. So take breaks, and build in breaks from the beginning! Remember that you can vary the length of your breaks, and consider taking a longer one after a couple rounds of role switching.

### Celebrate your victories

Any time you reach a tiny goal, or find a really neat solution to a problem, whether expected or unexpected, celebrate! It'll energize you and help you get ready for your next task! This could be as simple as a high-five, or some arms raised in victory if you're in a virtual situation.

### Communicate and be kind

Like in all good relationships, communication is essential for pair programming. Check-in with each other when it's time to switch, make sure your partner's ready, and give each other a minute to switch head-spaces.

### Don't rush

Pairing means that both people agree with and understand the direction the coding is going. It's perfectly fine to take a minute to discuss something! In fact, that's the whole goal! Pairing is the best way to learn.
